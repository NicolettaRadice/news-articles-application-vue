# news-articles-application-vue
Application made with Vue.js, uses a public API to fetch news articles and shows them on the landing page. There is also a random new section where you can get a random news article.

I have used a public API from newsapi.orf and sadly since June 2020 the api is only available for local deployement. If you want to see a preview check out the video i have inserted above.
Cheers,

Nicoletta
